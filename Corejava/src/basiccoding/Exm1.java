//every word in the application is a token .it is possible to provide any number of space in between two tokens.
//comments:
//detailed description about the appliaction logics.
//ex:in IT all the software application will be maintainable(means if one person develop the app and he resigns the company,then another person will maintain that code).so for understanding perpose will use comments.
